# Coursera Data Science Capstone Project

The application is the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization held by Johns Hopkins University and in cooperation with SwiftKey.

## Objective

The main goal of this capstone project is to build a shiny application that is able to predict the next word.

This exercise was divided into three sub tasks like data cleansing, exploratory analysis and the creation of a predictive model.

All text data that is used to create a frequency dictionary and thus to predict the next words comes from a corpus called HC Corpora.

All text mining and natural language processing was done with the usage of a variety of well-known R packages.

## Information

* The next word prediction app is hosted on shinyapps.io: https://fdaus.shinyapps.io/capstone_word_prediction_app/
